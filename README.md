# DroneShowDesigner
> Probably needs new name since it drives not only drones but also trusses and lights

> [!NOTE]
> This project is in early work-in-progress state. Report any issues you find.

> [!NOTE]
> To have bridge working, set your [HNode](https://github.com/Happyrobot33/HNode) port to 6455 (make sure you have the same port in DroneShowDesigner as output).

> [!NOTE]
> It takes original ArtNet packet, overrides predefined channels of objects and then sending it to the gridnode
